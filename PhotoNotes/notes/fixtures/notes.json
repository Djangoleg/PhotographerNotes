    "photo_comment": "What Is Mindful Walking?\nJust as mindfulness is the practice of bringing your attention to the present moment, mindful walking is the practice of becoming aware of your surroundings and how your body and mind feel while moving. Meditation isn’t necessarily about being still. For some people, movement is helpful for becoming more aware of their bodies and minds, as well as the present moment. Choose a route, preferably outdoors, where you can walk uninterrupted for at least 10 minutes. Dedicate the time simply to walking — mindful walking isn’t about getting to a destination or running an errand!",
